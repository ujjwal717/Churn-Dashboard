Situation

Understanding customer churn is very important for every business so that they can enhance their customer retention and improve sales. This project aims to provide insights into the customer churn for bank customers so that the company can make actionable decisions to reduce customer churn.

Task

As the lead data analyst on this project, I was responsible for designing and implementing a dashboard that would allow the stakeholders and decision-makers to explore key metrics related to customer churn. I worked closely with the project team to identify the most relevant data sources and key metrics to track. I then used Power BI, one of the most popular and powerful data visualization tools, to create an interactive dashboard that would allow stakeholders and decision-makers to explore the data in real-time.

Action

To create the dashboard, I got the data from the company and then performed cleaning, pre-processing, and transformation using Power Query. I also used the DAX formulas to create calculated columns and measures for detailed insights. I included key metrics such as Customers by Complaints, Customers by Products Purchased, Customers by Satisfaction Rate, Customers by Credit Score, and more. I also created two more report pages for Analysis by Age and Analysis by Gender to pinpoint the reasons for customer churn. I included slicers such as Customer Exited?, Customer has Credit Card?, and Country. The main dashboard page is given below.
